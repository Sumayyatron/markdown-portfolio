These are a few of my favorite things:
 * Rain drops on roses
   * Whiskers on kittens
 * Bright copper kettles
   * Warm woolen mittens
  * Brown paper packages tied up with strings
  - Cream-colored ponies
    - Crisp apple strudles
 - Door bells 
   - Sleigh bells
   - Schnitzel with noodles
- Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings
* Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes
* Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
* Silver white winters that melt into springs

These are a few of my favorite things.
